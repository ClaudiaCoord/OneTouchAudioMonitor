# OneTouch Audio Input Monitor (UWP)
### About 

`One Touch Audio Monitor` is designed to quickly switch input audio devices to selected output audio devices with one touch.  For example, it is relevant for quickly listening to a microphone, usually on headphones connected both with a wire and with a Bluetooth connection.

Supports all kinds of audio input and output devices, including Bluetooth devices.

Activation in the mode of output audio devices, or Bluetooth audio devices is provided.

When activated, the application automatically connects the pre-selected output device if it is connected and available.
